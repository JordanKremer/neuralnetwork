# Neuralnetwork
This project is an implementation of a neural network that utilizes C+++ parellelism libraries to analyze a large data set of color values.
Using a confusion matrix, test and training data, perceptrons, hidden layer, OpenMP, learning rate, momentum, and other coefficients, this program guesses the numbers (1 through 10) represented within the test data.
